We will use Python in google co-lab for the first day
- Create a google ID first if you don't have one
- Co-lab will also run better if you use google chrome as your browser
- Open the Day_1.ipynb and click the launch in google colab button on the top left corner
- Solutions will be made available at the end of the day. 

We will use the data file 'Hufallopiantube.h5ad'
- Download this to your computer and place it in your google drive

The second, third, and fourth day we will use R  in google co-lab
We will need 'X.csv', 'vars.csv' and 'obs.csv' - These contain the gene expression matrix, the gene names, and the observations/metadata
- Download these to your computer, and upload them to the Runtime session storage, the X.csv will take a while to upload
- Do remember to change Runtime type to R
